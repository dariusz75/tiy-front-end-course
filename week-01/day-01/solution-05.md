#What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.


##You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

* Gists
* Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
* Files with the .md or .markdown extension


##This is an example of unordered list

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
* Item 4

##And this is an example of ordered list

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
4. Item 4

##Some text examlpes

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

##Small table examlpe

First Header | Second Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------   -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2 | Content from cell 3
Content in the 1st column | Content in the 2nd column | Content in the 3th column
Another cell | and another cell | And another
